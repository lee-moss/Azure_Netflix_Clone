# Netflix Clone Deployment with Azure DevOps, Terraform, Docker, and Kubernetes

THIS IS AN ONGOING PROJECT AND WILL BE UPDATED FREQUENTLY

## Overview

This project aims to deploy a Netflix clone application using modern DevOps practices and tools. I will utilise Azure for cloud infrastructure, Terraform for infrastructure as code, Azure DevOps for continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD), Docker for containerisation, and Kubernetes for container orchestration. Additionally, I will monitor DevOps and Kubernetes metrics using Grafana, Prometheus, and Node exporter.
